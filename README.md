# Ultrasonic-Sensor
During college, as part of the Digital Electronics course, I collaborated on a team project to develop an ultrasonic sensor. This sensor is designed to detect obstacles and provide auditory warnings. The project was implemented using an Arduino Uno board and various required components.
